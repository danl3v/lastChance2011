     <h2>What is LCD</h2>
     <p>LCD allows you to discover the people you always wanted to dance with, but never had the chance or were too scared to ask.</p>
     <h2>How does it work</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>Sign in with Your Google Account</li>
       <li>Pair your Google Account with your Carleton Email ID</li>
       <li>Go to the preferences page and enter up to five people!</li>
       <li>Feel free to update your preferences until <strong>June 7, 2011</strong>, when your preferences will be locked and the system will start to calculate the matches</li>
       <li>A match occurs when you choose someone and that person also selects you.</li>
       <li>On <strong>June 10, 2011</strong> you will receive an automatically generated email with your matches.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
     <p>Always ask for consent, even with your matches.</p>
     <p>Don't dick around -- if you pick someone as a joke and they pick you back, how do you know they ain't dickin witchoo?</p>
     <h2>Privacy</h2>
     <p>Each person's preferences are stored in a secure database and cannot be accessed by anyone.</p>
