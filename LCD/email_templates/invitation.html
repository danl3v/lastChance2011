Hey Fellow Carleton Class of 2011 Student!

Last Chance Dance is your final opportunity to see if your secret crushes have been interested in you all this time. Enter your top 5 and if they're into it too, you'll get a chance to meet up and make the night what you want. You don't have to worry about your crushes knowing who you are because you are notified of each other only if the feelings are mutual.

The site was created by a few Carleton students and could be a fun opportunity for senior week. Even if you don't use it, feel free to check it out to see what your fellow seniors are up to.
