[+] Fixed things for conrad to verify
    [-] click "Logout" on preferences page.  gives error when runs "isPaired" thing because get_current_user returns None.  Either we can make that function stop if the current user isnt logged in or make the preferences page boot you back to main if youre not logged in
    [-] click "Logout" on /pair page. It should kick you to the mainpage.
    [-] Tried app.yamil "login: required" but this leaves a logged out user stuck in a loop.
    Current fix is to put "if !session.get_current_user()" at the top of everything, but this might be CPU heavy
